My first tries in making Tetris game in Java, back from beginning of 2016.

There are 2 folders, containing 2 different versions:
## 1. matrix-B&W - first version that I wrote on arrays.
It's black and white, with counting of points working. 
Mostly playable, only there is no gameover condition - game doesn't stop when tetromino reach top.

## 2. Color - second version I tried to make.
It's colored but unfinished. I tried to make it only with graphics, without array to check possitions, etc.
Tetromino can be moved, and rotated, but they don't detect each other.
It's still highly not finished version.
